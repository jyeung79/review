## Overall

The Canpur CP54e is an amazing TOTL all-rounder set that can be end game for many. It sounds very balanced where neither bass, mids, treble overpower each other. Same would say it would be neutral but its nothing close to a reference sound. The Canpur sounds musical and engaging. It also has a holographic soundstage with great separation meaning you hear all the details and notes clearly. The bass, hi-hats or effects are clearly in place with rich details.

### Comfort
They're a great fit. They seem quite large but the fits excellent. I usually have trouble with fit with my right ear. Most larger iems such as VE Elysium, Diva, Z1R are a pretty bad fit for me. Luckily, the Canpur's fit is not the same at all. They fit quite comfortably despite it's larger size.
One issue for me is pressure build-up. Just looking at the IEM there are vents and so it seems to be vented. I have not verified if it is. Yet, after 30mins of listening there's usually pressure buildup for me. I'm more sensitive to pressure build up so please take it with a grain of salt. Most people who are fine with BA iems shouldn't face any issue.

## Sound
### Bass
One of the best BA bass. Its punchy with great subbass and midbass. There's good impact and everything well defined. It doesn't get bloaty or messy on songs with a lot of bass. It's always well-controlled and clear. I do think the CP54E can be a bit overwhelming on more bassy songs especially the midbass can be a bit much. However, if you are a fan of bass especially good midbass I think the Canpur would fit your need. The only issue is that whether you like the bass is if you prefer DD vs BA bass. Personally, I enjoy the texture, decay and rumble of DD bass much more. I find the Canpur's bass to lack the same texture and impact of more famous DDs such as IE900. Yet at the same time, I would say the Canpur's bass is more natural and organic. It blends well with the rest of the frequencies. It stops at the perfect moment. At this point, it's just a matter of preference.
### Mids
However, the best part is the mids. It's one of the best mids I've heard and I would say its second to only the VE8 as in the most coherent and organic mids. Vocals are rich on this as both male and female vocals sound natural and pleasing to the ear. I do think female vocals sound better due to the abundant midbass but both sound fine. Guitars, pianos and other instruments sound clear and distinct. Very resolving mids and vocals. Sometimes the voices are so pleasing that it just sucks you in. I find myself more sensitive to vocals so the CP54e is like perfect amount before it becomes too forward or sibilant. 

### Treble
The EST drivers are wonderful producing crisp and clear details. The hi-hats, cymbals and "sparkles" are clear and detailed. They don't lack anything as you can hear it quite clearly in the songs. Although the treble is great it's not on the same degree as the Bass and Mids. It does seem kinda lacking as compared to the abundant bass and the luscious mids. As compared to the other two, the treble just ain't on par. On the other hand, the positive is that the treble isn't fatiguing as many EST driver implementation. So for those on the more sensitive side, then the treble would just fit.

## Songs
Tested on Qobuz with the Ibasso DX300

**Attention** sounds fantastic. The hi-hats shimmer clearly in the background yet it's not fatiguing. The vocals are pleasant to the ears particularly the chorus, sounds sweet with the treble effects and deep subbass rumble. This is a great set for Kpop enthusiast.

### Biri Biri - Yoasobi
<img src="https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b2730b0a33ba19141e1728827991" width="200" />
This track showcases the mix of the vocals, subbass and the treble. Even during the busy parts of the tracks, the treble remains clear and synth remains very distinct. Above all, the vocals are clear and there's great layering with all different instruments, demonstrating this as a very resolving set.
### Nukegara - Ado
<img src="https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b2737ac841876cee380bbeb3fdc1" width="200" />
In **Nukegara**, Ado's voice shines through completed with the different instruments and notes. The track feels immersive and holographic, thanks to the excellent imaging. It does a fantastic job in highlighting Ado's distinct voice.

### Stellar Stellar - Suisei Hoshimachi
<img src="https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b273f724e5bdf4ae3e50082c2403" width="200" />

This track serves as a great test for separation and imaging. After the brief capella in the beginning, the treble and the other effects kicks in. On less technical sets, everything would sound muddy and the notes would all blend together. Yet the Canpur is a champ keeping everything clear, ensuring everything stays distinct. When the chorus hits, the sense of immersion and impact is striking, with the guitars, drums, electronic synths, bass, and vocals imaged clearly.
### Liquid Spirit - Gregory Porter
<img src="https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b2731a5b559ef8a73cf7d08c8593" width="200"/>

Here is where the set shows its limitation. While Gregory's voice is clear but it lacks the richness found in other sets such as Aur Ascension or Fir Audio XE6. Mainly, the mid-bass detracts from the clarity and richness of male vocals. However, the piano, bass, trumpets all maintain rich detail. 
This song sounds great but falls short in comparison to female vocal only tracks.
### Talk - Khalid
<img src="https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e02b361ce46dbadbf8a11081b60" width="200"/>

Similar to "Liquid Spirit", the track exhibits the same flaws. Khalid's vocals are clear but lacking the infatuating allure as opposed to the previous female vocals tracks. The bass is well-defined and controlled never get messy or bloaty and the treble is crisp. And same as the previous track, it still sounds great.
### Feel So Good - Honne
<img src="https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e02387b8b58dfac97a9a10466cd" width="200"/>

With this song, the distinction between male and female vocals become quite obvious. The female vocals are intoxicating and rich while the male vocals are just lacking the same depth. On the other hand, the track excels at bringing out the Canpur's soundstage potential, creating an immersive and expansive holographic feeling.
### Be the One - Eli Brown

EDM sounds great on this set. I do think a W type signature is better for EDM such as the Mega5EST or 64Audio Trios. They sound way more engaging and fun. Nevertheless, the 54e is superior in technicalities - resolution, imaging, bass texture and separation. It still sounds great as it should as an all-rounder.
### Tank! - Seatbelts
<img src="https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b273a9e63ab423972dd5607cec2e" width="200"/>

An classic that truly highlights the precision and resolution of various musical instruments. The clarity of each instrument—from trumpet, guitar, bass guitar and bongos—is remarkable. The imaging is equally impressive as you can clearly pinpoint the locations of the instruments. This track truly showcases the Canpur's technical prowess.

## Comparisons
### Vision Ears VE8
*Comparison is when I compared them side-by-side but I don't have the VE8 on hand.*

The bass on the **Canpur CP54e** is superior—punchy with excellent impact and texture. It’s one of the best BA bass responses I’ve encountered. In contrast, the VE8’s bass is less controlled and tends to sound bloated.

When it comes to the mids, both IEMs excel, but I personally prefer the VE8's mids for their coherence and organic sound. While the difference is marginal (perhaps 5-10% better), the VE8 offers a richer and more natural sound in the mids.

The treble on the other hand is a toss-up. The Canpur’s EST treble is more detailed and defined, with better texture and clarity while the VE8's treble blends more seamlessly and is less forward. For more treble sensitive users, the VE8 would be more desirable. Overall, both sets are great, but the Canpur feels more balanced while the VE8's mids are the highlight.

### AAW Canary Pro
*Comparison is when I compared them side-by-side but I don't have the AAW Canary Pro on hand.*

The bass on the **Canary Pro** is less pronounced than on the Canpur with the CP54e having more bass overall. While I appreciate the texture of the Canary Pro’s DD bass, I prefer the Canpurs bass quantity more. Ultimately, it’s a close call and comes down to preference between DD vs BA.

In terms of mids, if the Canpur earns an S+ rating and the Canary Pro sits at an S-. The CP54e has richer, more engaging mids, whereas the Canary Pro’s mids are more recessed due to its V-shaped sound signature.

The standout feature of the Canary Pro is its treble. It offers some of the most beautiful treble I’ve ever heard—clear, detailed, and sharp without being fatiguing. For testing treble sibilance, I often turn to the bright track **“Love Bug”** by Gfriend. The treble is bright yet manageable, with clarity that sets it apart from many top-tier IEMs. It rivals the **VE EXT** and you can go either one and be satisfied. Listening to **“Attention”** by New Jeans is pure ecstasy, with all the sparkling treble rendered perfectly. While the Canpur also has excellent treble, it doesn’t quite reach the level of the Canary Pro’s.

Ultimately, your choice will depend on your preferences. If you seek an all-rounder, the Canpur is the better option; for a more fun and engaging sound, the Canary Pro is the way to go. I’d be satisfied with either one.
### Fir Audio XE6
*Comparison is when I compared them side-by-side but I don't have the XE6 on hand. It was tested with the red or lowest isolation nozzle.*

Honestly, right off the bat, the Canpur CP54e is way better technically and  it's way more balanced. It sounds great on across all frequency with better resolution. However, the XE6 does have a soft spot for me. It's embodies the very definition of the warmfi fudgy goodness. The bass is overwhelming yet super enjoyable to listen. The bass does bleed into the mids detracting the clarity but as long as you're not analyzing deeply, the XE6 is just a fun set. It's essentially an upgraded 64Audio Nio. The one thing I would applaud the XE6  in terms of technicalities is that the soundstage is wider than the Canpur.

Overall, I'd recommend the CP54e as a better all-arounder set. The XE6 on the lowest isolation would be more of a guilty pleasure set.
### Thieaudio Monarch Mk2

Although, they're not in the same price category and I haven't compared them directly, I feel it's worth mentioning. The reason being is that the Canpur 54e embodies what I envisioned the Monarch Mark II to become. 

The Canpur offers more mid bass, a richer and luscious midrange and more forward and more distinct treble. Essentially the CP54e is a more fun, engaging and technical MMK2. They're in different price categories albeit both models belong to the same all-rounder category. I thoroughly enjoy the Canpur way more in terms of technicalities, tuning and everything else.

## Conclusion

If you haven't already noticed, I really love this set. This an amazing set from Canpur that really sets the bar for TOTL all-rounders. Every time I listen to it, I get mesmerized at how effortlessly it 
delivers an intoxicating and immersive experience. I can't even use this while working because I tend to get lost in the music instead of my work xD. This could potentially be my end game set but there's a couple of factors holding me back. The first is totally preference but I enjoy DD bass texture more than BA. That is not to say the Canpur's bass is poor. In fact, it should be one of the best BA bass implementation to date but there's something to the decay and rumble of DD bass that BA can't replicate. Secondly for pressure sensitive users, there's pressure build up after listening for awhile. Most people wouldn't notice or have any issues with this. Without these issues, these would be my "end-game" set. I would be perfectly satisfied.

I wholeheartedly recommend this set as a great all-rounder set for a balanced U-sound signature. The Canpur dishes out amazing technicalities with intoxicating female vocals. Kpop, Jpop or any song with female vocals sound mesmerizing. Male vocals are also enjoyable but at this price point, there may be better options available. Nevertheless, I highly recommend this set wholeheartedly. In fact, I might consider buying this set again in the future.
